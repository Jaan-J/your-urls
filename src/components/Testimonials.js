                            what I wanted. I gave him a rough Idea of what I wanted, and he got started right away. Every step of
                            the way he kept me informed about what he was doing and asked me if it is to my liking. He was quick,
                            professional and got it done exactly how I wanted it. I would highly recommend his services to anyone
                            who is looking into making a website!"</p>

                                was able to build it exactly the way I wanted it, and even suggested some improvements that
                                enhanced the overall design and function. Despite having a busy schedule, Jaanâ€™s communication
                                throughout was exceptional and he was always great at understanding my needs and delivering the
                                desired outcome. I would definitely recommend working with Jaan to anyone looking to have any kind
                                of website built!"
